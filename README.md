# Watchmen (E-commerce platform for Watches)

This is an E-commerce website for watches using Node JS. The application loads
and displays products from a MongoDB database. Users can choose to see only products
from a single category. Users can get more information about any product by clicking
on it. Users can choose items to add to their shopping cart. I implemented all of the
necessary E-commerce features.
